                    This graph is just a fun example of Chart.js.

                    This is definitely one of my favorite libraries to use.

                    I originally made this to showcase where I feel my skills are strongest at comparatively, but really, just take this with a grain of salt.

                <h1>What am I working on right now?</h1>
                <p>Thanks for asking! I'm currently working on a <i>lot</i> of different projects, courses, and everything in between.</p>
                <p>Here's a pretty loose list of what's going on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking a fully fledged ASP.Net Core / Angular course.</li>
                    <li>Learning Python in my off-time so that I can get into the machine learning world.</li>
                    <li>I'm beginning a fellowship in something called <a href="https://chronic-coder.com/">CCA</a>. It is a program that brings together groups of ML/Backend Engineers, Frontend Developers, and UX/UI Designers to build something impactful; and learn in that process. We will build and ship an application using the same technologies and best practices as leaders in the field.</li>
                    <li>Trying to build up enough knowledge and skill to transition from front-end development, to something more along the lines of machine learning (or just back-end in general). If you know me well, you'll know that general back-end development and machine learning are what interests me most in this world.</li>
                    <li>I'm a huge video game fan. I constantly like to learn, create, and modify the games I play. There are a ton of them out there that support this, from Skyrim to Tabletop Simulator -- even Roblox or (my personal favorite) Garry's Mod. <span class="text-muted">They even named it after me!</span></li>
                    <li>In addition to mods, I also like to try my skill in actual game creation. I use Unity and C# personally, but I have dabbled in too many game engines to count. Unreal Engine 4, Unity, Godot, TC4, and even making my own (very bad at the moment) game engines using Javascript, believe it or not!</li>
                    <li>Of course, my day job. I'm <span class="text-muted">technically</span> a front-end developer intern for a pretty cool company called Yoodle. However, the company's needs seem to have pivoted at the time of writing, and I'm now primarily a program assistant. That's part of the reason why I made this website: I want to do something I truly and completely love.</li>
